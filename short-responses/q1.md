# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer

Middleware can be configured to run on all requests or a certain subset of requests, while controllers are limited to executing on one route. They can also stop requests before they reach subsequent middleware or controllers.

Yes, but a major distinction that you're missing is that middleware often does not send a response back to the client but instead passes control to the next middleware/controller in the chain.
